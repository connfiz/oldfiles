          <P>he domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a canid that is known as man's best friend.

             The dog was the first domesticated animal and has been widely kept as a working, hunting, and pet companion.

             According to recent coarse estimates, there are currently between 700 million and one billion dogs, making them the most abundant member of order Carnivora in the world.

             There is many different types of dogs.The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both of the domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".

             The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk≈çn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle"). The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others. The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal. In 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category "hound"
